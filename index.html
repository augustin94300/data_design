        <p>The Internet and social networks have enabled a development (rise) in communications. Information comes and goes increasingly faster. Today, all you need is a smartphone to communicate on social networks. This ease of putting online allows everyone to become their own journalist, and to publish their opinion, questions and queries quickly.
          <br> <br>
          Before the internet, it was the media that had the role of informing the population. This information was verified and studied by groups of people whose job it was. The information was sure.

        <div class="complot_text_2">
          Today, anyone can post information without it being peer-reviewed. The number of "journalists" has exploded and the large number of competitors forces them to react as quickly as possible, sometimes without checking. This therefore allows some false information to be published and seen by everyone. 
          <br><br>
          Theory of reptilians, flatism, Qanon, Apollo 13 a set-up, global warming a lie and others even wackier.

          Unscrupulous people use and develop these theories (often for pecuniary gain). For example, Alex Jones, an American specializing in conspiracy theories, who has gathered a strong community. He publishes theories revolving around the end of the world to encourage his followers to invest in survivalist equipment that he sells on his website.
          <br><br>
          These theories are dangerous, in addition to misinformation, they can lead to dangerous behavior. Some Americans are convinced that it was Donald Trump who won the elections in 2021, which sparked violent demonstrations (protest) and an intrusion into the capitol.
